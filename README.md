# Market-Basket-Analysis
Market basket analysis is a tool that retailers mostly use to identify the most popular product combinations that customers purchase together. Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) analysis is a useful tool that helps organizations divide their clientele into coherent groups so that different targeted marketing campaigns may be launched for each group

Market basket analysis can be done in a number of ways, but the Association Rules (AR) approach is still the most common and commonly used. This method—best represented by the Apriori Technique—examines transactional data to reveal strong trends by determining relationships that happen more frequently than anticipated and gauging the frequency of co-occurring items. The Apriori Technique is a well-known AR algorithm that is widely used in market basket research. It was first introduced by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant in 1994 [1]. This approach starts by identifying the most common features in large-scale datasets, and then uses augmented reality (AR) to reveal interesting latent links using important metrics including Support, Confidence, Lift, and Conviction.

The increased lift values observed in the Association Rules (AR) results can be attributed to common patterns, specifically the associations between combo→combo, combo→item, and item→combo. A higher lift value indicates a stronger connection between these sets of items.
